# Introduction
This code is based on https://github.com/arjonal/wisp5. We mainly modified [`TxFM0.asm`](CCS/wisp-base/RFID/TxFM0.asm) and [`WISP_doRFID.asm`](CCS/wisp-base/RFID/WISP_doRFID.asm) to realize additional M2/M4/M8 encoding schemes. The official instruction about purchasing and using the tags can be found here: https://github.com/wisp/wisp5.
